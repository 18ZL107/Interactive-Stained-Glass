# Interactive Stained Glass Research Project Overview
Interactive stained glass devices are a form of screen-free technology that are able to aesthetically integrate into a home. Our project presents a method of integrating technology into a home, by combining stained glass art and circuitry into interactive devices. We discussed the devices produced through collaborative ideation with 9 participants across 3 different households. The use of daily journaling, as well as introduction and completion interviews, offers insight into the perceived effect these devices had within the households.

### Prototype 
During our interview with one group of participants, a five-person household proposed a 3D device to record, store, and play back audio recordings, called the HOMEmory.
